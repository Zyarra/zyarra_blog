In the remaining population of over 17 million Netherlands residents, nearly 21 thousand people died in this period - about 3,500 people or 20 percent more than usual.

"Netherlands using more renewable energy, mostly biomass"," In 2019 the Netherlands' energy consumption from renewable sources grew by 16 percent compared to the year before.

A total of 181 petajoules of the country's energy came from renewable sources. More than half of that increase was due to more biomass, mainly due to power plants using more biodiesel and biogasoline, Statistics Netherlands reported on Friday. 
Last year, 8.6 percent of the Netherlands total 2,100 petajoules energy consumption came from renewable sources. In 2018 the Netherlands also used a total of 2,100 petajoules of energy, of which 7.4 percent came from renewable sources. Agreements made in the European Union state that 14 percent of the Netherlands' energy must be renewable. That goal was not achieved last year.
Biomass is the largest source of renewable energy in the Netherlands, accounting for 60 percent of the total. Energy consumption from this source increased by 15 percent to 106 petajoules last year. This is partly because coal-fired power plants started using more biomass in 2019 - an increase stimulated by subsidy. Biomass accounted for 5.06 percent of the total energy consumption last year. 
The consumption of solar energy increased significantly in 2019, by 37 percent to 20 petajoules.

After two cell towers in Roermond and Roosendaal were set alight this week, the total number of transmission mast arson incidents in the country stands at 29. So far only three suspects have been arrested for two of the fires.
Earlier this week, Minister Ferdinand Grapperhaus of Justice and Security said that all C2000 masts, the masts used by the emergency services to communicate, will get extra security in the coming period, AD reports.
There will also be extra surveillance at ""intersections"" where several transmission towers are connected, Anja Spronk of NOVEC, a company with about 850 transmission towers, said to the newspaper. 
The government, telecom companies, and mast operators are discussing what else can be done. ""You can think of extra locks and better hinges and locks, but arson is difficult to prevent,"" Ed Boerema of Cellnex, which owns a proportion of the masts in the Netherlands, said to the newspaper. ""We experimented with cameras in the past, but that was not a success. They were vandalized and there were many false reports.""
There are tens of thousands of antennas in the Netherlands, not only on masts, but also on the roofs of parking garages and other buildings. 
The authorities believe the arson incidents are connected to conspiracy theories about the 5G network. A popular conspiracy theory online suggests that 5G weakens people's immune systems and leave them vulnerable to diseases and viruses, like the current coronavirus pandemic. There is no scientific evidence for this claim.

At the end of March 2020 a total of 413 thousand Netherlands residents up to state pension age received a general social assistance benefit, a thousand more than at the end of February 2020. Despite this month-to-month increase, the number of active general welfare benefits was still 2 thousand lower than the previous quarter, and 19 thousand lower than the first quarter of 2019.

The data follows as the group found that 85 new companies filed for bankruptcy over the mid-May period.
According to Statistics Netherlands, 60 percent of catering establishments with fewer than 250 employees have been benefiting from the TOGS scheme, a government support scheme that grants up to four thousand euros to affected companies in sectors which have been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic. This number is considerably higher than the percentage across all sectors, which stands at 26 percent, according to Statistics Netherlands.
Other sectors that saw more than than three quarters of companies claim government support included clothing stores for men's and women's undergarments, fairground attractions and taxi services.
At the same time, a total of 85 companies filed for bankruptcy in between May 18 and 22; a more than seven percent decrease on the previous week's numbers, the research group reported. Since the year's beginning, a total of 1,575 companies have filed for bankruptcy, a 60 percent rise since the same period in 2019.
The figures follow a week on from the newest set of economic relief measures, which are set to pump an additional 13 billion euros into the Dutch economy in order to try to support entrepreneurs facing financial ruin due to the Covid-19 crisis.

The man was arrested on charges of phishing, hacking and extortion of a sexual nature after he tried to trick Snapchat users into clicking on a link, which would supposedly give insights about the spread of Covid-19 in the area, according to police. When clicked, the link would immediately prompt users to log in again using their Snapchat account, allowing the suspect to steal their login credentials.
This practice would often be followed by ""sextortion,"" in which the man would threaten to distribute private photos of the victim in exchange for money or bitcoin, the police said. He had also demanded sexually compromising photos of his victims in exchange for returning control of their account. Over 20 victims have fallen for the man's scheme, all of whom come from Noord-Holland.
""Some of them are known to be deeply affected by this type of crime. The criminal investigation department is satisfied with this development in the investigation and is working hard on the case,"" wrote the police in a statement. None of them paid the extortion demand, police said.

The second incident involved a gay couple being attacked with sharp glass in Amsterdam Oost on May 21, and led to the arrest of three teenagers.

Ban on mink transports and barn visits after Covid research ," Mink can no longer be transported in the Netherlands, nor can people visit the animals on farms, according to a letter by two prominent ministers directed to the parliament on Thursday. ",https://nltimes.nl/2020/05/28/ban-mink-transports-barn-visits-covid-research, Ban on mink transports and barn visits after Covid research  ,"Mink can no longer be transported in the Netherlands, nor can people visit the animals on farms, according to a letter by two prominent ministers directed to the parliament on Thursday.
The new guidelines, laid out by the Ministers of Health and Agriculture, Hugo de Jonge and Carola Schouten respectively, are designed to minimize the risk of animal-to-human transmission of Covid-19. In effect, they put an end to the transport of mink and mink manure, ensure that hygiene protocols are in place for people exposed to the animals, and ban visitors from entering barns where mink are kept.
""These measures concern all mink farms in the Netherlands and not only those where there is an infection found it,"" added the ministers.
In addition, the guidelines stipulate that mink farmers must prevent dogs, cats and ferrets from entering and leaving mink farms as much as possible, and recommend that mink farmers with symptoms of illness be tested for Covid-19.
Schouten and De Jonge added that they will draw up a more complete recommendation after the Outbreak Management Team's zoonosis arm convenes next week. ""All measures imaginable will be considered. We inform the House [of Representatives] on this as soon as possible next week,"" they wrote.
The news follows after weeks of concern around the risk of mink-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus, with Schouten asserting last week that a link between the two is plausible. Earlier this month, the government also made screening for Covid-19 antibodies compulsory for mink farmers, in order to keep an eye on the risk.
