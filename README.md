# Django webserver project
## + Webscraping
### With Admin panel, post and comment approval system etc.


to try locally:
'''python manage.py runserver'''
the scrape script should work for www.nltimes.com if you hit 'scrape'
scrape needs to be built separately for each site so only this is available.
