"""Coronaspitters"" to be immediately tested for Covid-19"," Members of the public who deliberately cough or spit at police officers will be forced to be immediately tested for coronavirus, if a new emergency measure put forward on Friday wins parliamentary approval.
The law has been put in place after a spate of spitting and coughing incidents aimed at police, bus drivers, and store personnel were recorded in recent weeks, prompting concerns over the transmission of the coronavirus. ",https://nltimes.nl/2020/04/03/coronaspitters-immediately-tested-covid-19,"Members of the public who deliberately cough or spit at police officers will be forced to be immediately tested for coronavirus, if a new emergency measure put forward on Friday wins parliamentary approval.
The law has been put in place after a spate of spitting and coughing incidents aimed at police, bus drivers, and store personnel were recorded in recent weeks, prompting concerns over the transmission of the coronavirus.
The test will include the use of a saliva swab and paper cup to allow for ascertaining quick results. “This way we can immediately pick those people out in order to be able to protect the police properly,"" Minister of Justice and Security Ferd Grapperhaus told news agency NOS after a cabinet meeting on Friday. “They take that mucus with a cotton swab, just as you see on CSI!”
The emergency measure, which was approved by the Cabinet on Friday, is expected to be brought in front of parliament in the coming weeks, Grapperhaus added.
This comes the same day that the Ministry of Justice and Security announced that any member of the public who is convicted of assaulting a civil servant will no longer be eligible for a community service sentence. The law, which was originally in place only for perpetrators of violent crime, has today been extended to include all civil servants, including police, healthcare workers and firefighters.

Coronavirus also slowing down criminal assassination attempts: report," The coronavirus crisis is also having an effect on the the Netherlands' criminal underworld. The police received information that planned assassinations are being postponed after social distancing measures were implemented to curb the spread of Covid-19, Jan Struijs of police union NPB said to the Telegraaf.
According to Struijs, the slow down in murder attempts may have to do with the emptier streets - getaway cars are now easier to spot and follow. ""The chance of getting caught is greater now,"" he said to the newspaper. ",https://nltimes.nl/2020/04/03/coronavirus-also-slowing-criminal-assassination-attempts-report,"The coronavirus crisis is also having an effect on the the Netherlands' criminal underworld. The police received information that planned assassinations are being postponed after social distancing measures were implemented to curb the spread of Covid-19, Jan Struijs of police union NPB said to the Telegraaf.
According to Struijs, the slow down in murder attempts may have to do with the emptier streets - getaway cars are now easier to spot and follow. ""The chance of getting caught is greater now,"" he said to the newspaper.
But that doesn't mean crime has come to a stand still. Organized crime is responding to the crisis with corona-related cybercrime, fraud, and the production of counterfeit products, Struijs said. ""Criminals are extremely creative. Look at drug sales. Due to the closed hospitality and canceled events, part of the sales market has disappeared. What we are seeing now is an increase in drugs by mail."" 
Struijs is also concerned about hygiene measures meaning that there is now less cash in circulation. ""Criminals like cash and become desperate. Chances are greater of robberies and burglaries at home. More chance of violence being used.""
Investigations are also being hindered by the virus and measures to curb it. Protective measures make it more difficult to intercept a drug transport, arrest criminals involving several countries, or question witnesses abroad. ""I hear from the intelligence department that with about 80 percent of the information now received by the police, nothing can be done,"" Strijs said. 
According to Struijs, the long-term effects the coronavirus will have on crime and the fight against it, are hard to predict. ""The criminal investigation department now has to very quickly switch to tackling new forms of crime, only to switch back after the corona crisis,"" he said.

"Victims, attorneys want courts to handle more cases; thousands delayed by Covid-19"," Despite the coronavirus crisis, courts urgently need to handle more criminal cases, according to defense lawyers, the Bar Association, and victims. Many thousands of criminal cases are being delayed because the courts and tribunals closed to all but the most urgent cases in mid-March. And the already significant backlogs are building up, NOS reports. ",https://nltimes.nl/2020/04/03/victims-attorneys-want-courts-handle-cases-thousands-delayed-covid-19,"Despite the coronavirus crisis, courts urgently need to handle more criminal cases, according to defense lawyers, the Bar Association, and victims. Many thousands of criminal cases are being delayed because the courts and tribunals closed to all but the most urgent cases in mid-March. And the already significant backlogs are building up, NOS reports.
The Dutch Association for Criminal Defense Lawyers calls for the courts to reopen. ""Courthouses and rooms are often very large. It is therefore possible to hold a hearing and still comply with existing regulations,"" chairman Jeroen Soeteman said. ""We understand the difficult situation that the judiciary is now, but if experts can agree with this working method, we must apply it. Now criminal law is almost completely halted.""
The Bar Association supports this call, saying it receives similar signals from other jurisdictions. Currently only lawsuits in which a decision has to be urgently made is being handled. According to the Bar, the term urgent is ""very strictly defined"" 
Victim Support Netherlands also hopes that the judiciary will at least make more digital hearings possible. ""Postponing cases will only increase the already long lead times,"" spokesperson Jytte Reichert said to NOS. ""While a lawsuit is so important for victims and surviving loved ones. Only after a substantive hearing they can get closure.""
On March 6th, shortly before the coronavirus really became a crisis in the Netherlands, the Public Prosecution Service reported that some 23 thousand criminal cases had to be postponed due to capacity problems. With the coronavirus closing court rooms, those postponed cases just keep piling up. The Amsterdam court, for example, held only eight hearings scheduled this week, compared to 60 criminal cases per week a month ago, according to the broadcaster. 
""Physical hearings are very rare now, but that does not mean that the entire judiciary has come to a standstill,"" a spokesperson for the Council for the Judiciary said to NOS. Some cases are handled in writing, others via video- or phone call. The Council said that the number and types of cases considered urgent enough to handle will increase in the near future. Talks are currently underway with lawyers and the Public Prosecution Service, among others, to handle more cases in writing or by phone. 
The Council also said that in almost all cantonal cases, a ruling was made this past week. These involve smaller cases like speeding offenses. In total, judges gave 22 thousand rulings - just under 80 percent of the normal number of cases in a week, according to the broadcaster.

LGBTQ students and pupils experience more discrimination: report," More pupils and students in the Netherlands feel discriminated against than five years ago. Especially among young people of the LGBTQ community report more violence, threats, and sexual harassment aimed against them, according to a report 'Experienced discrimination in the Netherlands II' by social planning agency SCP, RTL Nieuws reports. ",https://nltimes.nl/2020/04/02/lgbtq-students-pupils-experience-discrimination-report,"More pupils and students in the Netherlands feel discriminated against than five years ago. Especially among young people of the LGBTQ community report more violence, threats, and sexual harassment aimed against them, according to a report 'Experienced discrimination in the Netherlands II' by social planning agency SCP, RTL Nieuws reports.
Students and pupils with a migration background and students and pupils who are part of the LGBTQ community expedience relatively high levels of discrimination in education. Of all pupils and students in the Netherlands, between 2 and 3 percent indicate that they've quit their studies due to discrimination. Among the LGBTQ community, this is much higher at 8 percent.
27 percent of all Dutch people experience discrimination, about the same as five years ago. But there were shifts in ""where and who experienced how much discrimination,"" the SCP said. For example, Netherlands residents experience more discrimination on the grounds of gender and disability. And Dutch-Turks and Dutch-Moroccans reported experiencing less discrimination than in 2013, though they are still the groups with the highest percentages of experienced discrimination.
""It is plausible that social developments played a role in these shifts. For example, #metoo probably not only delineated the boundaries of acceptable interpersonal behavior, but also increased the recognition of violations and reduced the tolerance for violations.""
The results of this study, done on behalf of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, does not surprise Astrid Oosenbrug of LGBTQ interest organization COC. She calls on the government to tighten the requirements for tackling LGBTQ discrimination in schools, and for this to form a mandatory part in teacher training.

Police take ten scam coronavirus webshops offline," Over the past weeks, the Dutch police took down ten web shops who were selling coronavirus related scams. These online stores offered items ranging from antibacterial bank cards, to a Covid-19 tracker, and included multiple web shops offering medical masks for sale, the police said in a statement.  ",https://nltimes.nl/2020/04/01/police-take-ten-scam-coronavirus-webshops-offline,"Over the past weeks, the Dutch police took down ten web shops who were selling coronavirus related scams. These online stores offered items ranging from antibacterial bank cards, to a Covid-19 tracker, and included multiple web shops offering medical masks for sale, the police said in a statement. 
According to the police, anti-coronavirus measures restricting people to their homes, combined with uncertainty and the need for information that entails, make fertile ground for cyber criminals. The police haven't seen a noticeable increase in online crime, but did notice that criminals are taking advantage of current events. For example, a fake email made to look like it came from the RIVM was infecting computers with malware. And there was a fake WhatsApp message about a benefit for people out of work due to the virus, through which criminals tried to get bank details.
The national hotline for online fraud LMIO received many reports about suspicious web shops offering corona related products over the past weeks. Investigation resulted in 10 such online stores being taken offline. ""We are trying to thwart criminals and disrupt their fraudulent practices so that no more people are victims,' Gijs van der Linden of LMIO said. ""We take the measure that has the fastest effect, the most effect. That's not always looking for the one behind it.""
The police warn that cyber criminals will continue to abuse this crisis for as long as it continues. ""It is therefore important that people also take precautions themselves,"" said Theo van der Plas, program manager of Digitization and Crime at the police. ""For example, by properly securing devices. We hear that older computers are dusted off so that every family member can work at home. Then make sure that the security is up to date with the most recent anti-virus programs.""
""It also doesn't hurt to take a critical look at your passwords use a long sentence for that,"" Van der Plas advised. ""And never just click on a link. Official authorities and banks never ask for personal information via text message, email or app.""

"Body of missing Scottish man, 21, found in Duivendrecht"," A pedestrian walking in Duivendrecht Wednesday morning found the body of 21-year-old Matthew McCombe. The Scottish man had been missing since March 14, after he left his hotel early that morning.
Police would not speculate on foul play, saying only that his cause of death was under investigation, police told NL Times. His body was found at about 9:10 a.m. in the water at the Molenkade, part of a wide area where volunteers and rescue workers had focused their efforts in the two weeks after he disappeared.

The Scottish man had been missing since March 14, after he left his hotel early that morning.
Police would not speculate on foul play, saying only that his cause of death was under investigation, police told NL Times. His body was found at about 9:10 a.m. in the water at the Molenkade, part of a wide area where volunteers and rescue workers had focused their efforts in the two weeks after he disappeared.
McCombe was staying at the Novotel in Amsterdam Zuid for the weekend, celebrating his birthday with some friends. He walked out of the hotel towards the RAI convention center at 6:15 a.m., and a half-hour later he was walking on Amsteldijk near the Berlagebrug, a bridge over the Amstel river, surveillance camera footage showed.
McCombe's father had been in town to try and track down his son's whereabouts. The social distancing measures in place to fight the spread of coronavirus made it difficult to coordinate a large volunteer search effort, a family representative said.
He was identified by the Scottish Sun newspaper as being the grandson of football legend Billy McNeill, who captained Celtic when the team won its 1967 European Cup.
Anyone who might have seen McCombe after his disappearance should contact police so they can piece together the events that led up to Wednesday morning's discovery.

Of the arrest, Etten-Leur mayor Miranda de Vries said, ""Good to hear that the suspect was arrested,"" adding praise for police officers on the case.""Perhaps - aside from this great tragedy - this also brings peace to people who were frightened.""

Very busy recreation park
An influx of athletes and visitors at the Wilhelminaberg, an artificial mountain surrounded by a recreation park, forced authorities in Landgraaf and South Limburg to cut off access to the area. Officials said the crowds arrived ""despite the frequent repetition of the measures against the spread of the corona virus.

The hotel contacted police when they discovered the party taking place, according to Nu.nl.

Netherlands stays home: Empty beaches & streets with some exceptions," Beaches, streets and public areas across the Netherlands stood largely quiet on Saturday as the public continued to adhere to the new rule that requires 1.5 meters distance to be kept between people. The quietude comes in spite of the fair weather forecasts for the weekend which similarly drew large crowds to gather a week ago even after government and health officials pleaded with them to remain home as much as possible to help quell the coronavirus pandemic. ",https://nltimes.nl/2020/03/28/netherlands-stays-home-empty-beaches-streets-exceptions,"Beaches, streets and public areas across the Netherlands stood largely quiet on Saturday as the public continued to adhere to the new rule that requires 1.5 meters distance to be kept between people. The quietude comes in spite of the fair weather forecasts for the weekend which similarly drew large crowds to gather a week ago even after government and health officials pleaded with them to remain home as much as possible to help quell the coronavirus pandemic.
Large beaches such as Scheveningen, Zandvoort, Bloemendaal and Noordwijk were shown to be almost empty in live videos streamed from the coast. Prominent public areas such as the Dam Square in Amsterdam remained practically deserted, as groups of three or more people were forbidden in public, with some exceptions for families and housemates. This compared to the previous weekend, where emergency services were forced to issue an NL-Alert to remind people of the health advisory.
Sunshine was forecast across the Netherlands on Saturday. A mix of sunny and cloudy weather, along with chilly temperatures, was predicted for Sunday, according to meteorological agency KNMI.
In spite of all-round public restraint, however, several incidents were reported on Saturday as small crowds gathered in various parts of the country. In the Hague, for example, large numbers of people flocked to local organic food sellers, one of which was hit with an emergency order to close due to the small crowds that it drew.
Similarly, police intervened in a gathering of 24 people, who, according to AD, had gathered in a single hotel room on the Kruiskade in Rotterdam to throw a party. Members of the group each received a fine of an undisclosed amount for not adhering to the social distancing measures put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19, as well as for allegedly consuming alcohol and drugs, and setting fire to the hotel stairwell.
The incidents come a day after the Prime Minister Mark Rutte again urged all residents to remain indoors insofar as is possible, and a week after large crowds flocked to the beaches and dunes in spite of Rutte’s previous advice that people avoid crowding.
This week, the authorities began serving fines to people across the country for unlawfully gathering.

"Coronavirus Assault: Ten different arrests for abuse of police, workers"," Since the coronavirus pandemic began in late February, police have arrested at least ten different people for threatening police, bus drivers and supermarket staff with a coronavirus infection by spitting at them or coughing on them. The incidents are causing more concern among police officers, who have already modified their approach to criminal and domestic intervention because of the ongoing health crisis. ",https://nltimes.nl/2020/03/28/coronavirus-assault-ten-different-arrests-abuse-police-workers,"Since the coronavirus pandemic began in late February, police have arrested at least ten different people for threatening police, bus drivers and supermarket staff with a coronavirus infection by spitting at them or coughing on them. The incidents are causing more concern among police officers, who have already modified their approach to criminal and domestic intervention because of the ongoing health crisis.
A court in Limburg convicted a 19-year-old from Sittard on Friday for saying he had coronavirus and spitting on a bus driver. The incident happened on Tuesday around 5 p.m. at Maastricht Centraal after the bus driver confronted the teen for not having enough credit on his public transit card to cover the bus fare. ""The court takes into account that we live in a bizarre and violent time where the impact of behavior is greater, than in normal circumstances,"" a statement from the court noted. He was convicted for making threats that when combined with any crime ""endanger the general safety of people."" He was given an eight-week prison sentence, and ordered to pay the victim 450 euros.
Coughing in people's faces to cut a coffeeshop line
In Den Bosch, a 28-year-old man was convicted on Wednesday for ""deliberately coughing in people's faces and shouting that he has corona,"" the court said. ""He also violently opposed his arrest and assaulted and insulted a police officer. He also threatened the agent with coronavirus infection and spat at the agent.""
He was accused of cutting in line at a Den Bosch coffeeshop on March 15 moments after the Dutch government briefly ordered the cannabis operators to shut down as part of a series of early measures against the spread of the contagious virus. ""Watch out! Corona, corona!"" he shouted, while coughing in people's faces, the court said. A police officer responded and ordered him to leave. The man allegedly complied, but returned. When an officer tried to arrest him, the man kicked the police officer, spat on him, aggressively insulted him, and flipped him a middle finger.
The man, also from Den Bosch, was sentenced to nine weeks behind bars, of which two will be suspended if the man meets court-ordered conditions. He was given an extra week in jail for another offense, and ordered to pay the police officer 384 euros in restitution. ""You simply took advantage of the situation purely for your own gain,"" the court said, in spite of the man's stated regret.
""You want corona? Here, come and get it!""
Police arrested a man they referred to as a ""Corona Menace"" at Utrecht Centraal on Monday after responding to a report that the 35-year-old was trying to steal food inside a store. He was found lying on the shop floor and was helped up by authorities, who said they wanted to address the matter with him in private. He was told to sit down for fear he would fall over from excessive drinking.
That's when the man aggressively jumped into action, police said. “You don't tell me what to do! You want corona? Here come and get it!”
He then spat five times at the police officers who barely managed to dodge the flying sputum. He will face accusations of attempted aggravated assault and making threats on April 1, police said.

A 21-year-old Leeuwarden man was placed in custody for two weeks on Tuesday while an investigation continues into accusations that he bit a nightwatchman at a homeless shelter. He allegedly threatened him with death and spat on the guard. ""At the police station, the suspect blew his nose, the snot ending up on his hands and the floor of an interrogation room,"" the prosecutor said. He then allegedly told a police officer, ""Sit in front of me with your medical masks, boy, I will give you diseases."" That happened on March 20, one week after he was accused of threatening two mental healthcare workers with arson and aggravated abuse. ""Personality problems"" may have played a role in the incidents, the prosecutor said.
Choking one cop, spitting at another: ""I will finish you!""
An Utrecht woman was convicted of choking a police officer and spitting in another's face, resulting in her entering isolation to protect others from disease. It started on March 18 when police went to her home on Ossewagendreef because the woman's roommate was locked out of the apartment and she was unresponsive. A locksmith opened the door for a well-being check, and police found the woman under the influence of alcohol, the prosecutor in the case said. When police tried to mediate a dispute between the two tenants, the 49-year-old woman shouted, ""I will finish you!"" and grabbed one of the officers by the throat several times, prosecutors alleged. Then, at the police station, ""the woman called out that she had corona and spat at the officers,"" the prosecutor said. Later in a holding cell, she spat in an officer's face. ""As a result, the agent is now isolated and can no longer have contact with her partner, children and parents,"" because they are at an increased risk of illness, the prosecutor said. She was sentenced to two weeks in prison, with two more weeks conditionally suspended. 
Some routine traffic stops are anything but routine: ""Those gloves won't help you.""
Also on March 20, an ordinary traffic stop was the catalyst for a similar incident. The suspect, the police said, ignored signals to stop repeatedly before eventually pulling over. The unlicensed driver emerged from his uninsured car and marched up to Henk, the 55-year-old officer involved, saying that he had just returned from a visit with his friend. Then, ""he coughed in the face of a police officer and said, 'My comrade has corona,'' according to the prosecutor. Henk was nose-to-nose with the 52-year-old suspect at the time, the officer told Dagblad van het Noorden. ""I was really shocked by that,"" Henk told the newspaper. ""I have a family and parents who are already in their eighties.” He said he filed a charge against the Nieuw-Beerta man for attempted aggravated abuse.
Another man who was pulled over on March 18 for dangerous driving and possibly driving under the influence coughed in the face of the two responding police officers. ""Nice guys, I have the corona virus. Now you too!"" the prosecutor said the man told the police. ""I've been tested for it,"" the 23-year-old claimed. ""So those gloves won't help you."" He later said he was lying at the time. The Noordwijkerhout man was sentenced two days later to a 10-week jail term, of which two weeks were conditionally suspended. He may have to pay undisclosed financial damages, the prosecutor said.
Spitting and coughing at police in Amsterdam
Two separate incidents also on Tuesday took place in Amsterdam, the first when a woman in Amsterdam-Noord allegedly coughed in the faces of two police officers. The 30-year-old woman was reportedly pulled over by police for driving too fast at about 2:30 p.m., and responded by getting out of the car and screaming, wrote the Parool. When asked for her identification, she then responded by coughing hard at the responding officers.
Hours later in Amsterdam Oost police responded to a reported disturbance at a grocery store on Celebesstraat. Officers tried to remove a 46-year-old man from the supermarket, and the man is alleged to have spat at them.
Abusing a supermarket manager at closing time
A Lelystad man was also given a 40-hour community service sentence on March 20 for spitting in a supermarket manager's face two days prior. He tried sneaking through the store's exit doors just after the store closed for the evening. He began packing his groceries as the manager told him to leave. When the manager took the 28-year-old suspect's groceries from him, the suspect allegedly spat on the manager's clothes and face. Of the victim, the prosecutor said, ""He felt angry and gross and was afraid of being infected.""
The judge in the case said, ""Given the special situation we are in now, I find spitting very intense. In principle, a prison sentence would be appropriate and required."" However the man was given a lighter sentence because he was not recently convicted of a violent crime and his profession, which was not disclosed, was on the list of vital professions needed to keep society running.

Pharmaceutical vandalized after coronavirus test criticism," A branch of pharmaceutical firm Roche on Transistorstraat in Almere was vandalized overnight. The phrase ""How many deaths?"" was spray painted on its wall, and a sign with the text ""Fuck Roche profit"" was left at the building, Omroep Flevoland reports. ",https://nltimes.nl/2020/03/27/pharmaceutical-vandalized-coronavirus-test-criticism,"A branch of pharmaceutical firm Roche on Transistorstraat in Almere was vandalized overnight. The phrase ""How many deaths?"" was spray painted on its wall, and a sign with the text ""Fuck Roche profit"" was left at the building, Omroep Flevoland reports.
The Swiss company was criticized during a parliamentary debate on Thursday. There were reports that Roche was refusing to share a recipe of a fluid needed for the Covid-19 test, resulting in hospitals being unable to make the material themselves. Various political parties wanted to force the company to release this recipe. 
Esther de Rooij, head of the Dutch branch of Roche, denied these accusations on television program Jinek on Thursday evening. According to her, the recipe is ""freely available"" and the company also made all the necessary information available on how to best produce it.. But making the fluid themselves will cost hospitals valuable time, test material and personnel, she said.

Tax Authority had 'hard targets' for money recovered from 'fraudsters': report," For years the Tax Authority had hard targets for amounts that had to be recovered from paid allowances. If they did not reach these targets, they had to scrutinize more potential fraudsters to achieve the 'minimum yield', Trouw and RTL Nieuws report based on their own research. ",https://nltimes.nl/2020/03/27/tax-authority-hard-targets-money-recovered-fraudsters-report,"For years the Tax Authority had hard targets for amounts that had to be recovered from paid allowances. If they did not reach these targets, they had to scrutinize more potential fraudsters to achieve the 'minimum yield', Trouw and RTL Nieuws report based on their own research.
These hard targets partly resulted in the so-called childcare allowance scandal. Thousands of parents were unjustly labeled fraudsters and ordered to repay their childcare allowances, leaving families in impossible situations, according to the National Ombudsman. The Donner committee who investigated this affair spoke of a ""form of moral corruption"" by the Tax authority. 
The hard targets came from agreements made in 2013 to tackle fraud more harshly, according to RTL. Investments were made in extra personnel and software in the fight against fraud - the costs of which had to be covered by recovered allowances, the broadcaster wrote. 
Documents in the news agencies' possession show that in the summer of 2018, for example, the Allowances department warned that the ""minimum yield of the business case Fraud (25 million euros)"" will not be achieved. The document stated for this reason, the ""risk selection"" was being tightened and the service was going to check thousands of people with allowances very intensively, according to RTL. 
A spokesperson for State Secretary Alexandra van Huffelen, responsible for Allowances, told RTL that the Tax Authority did indeed work with targets in the hunt for fraud since 2013, but that this method was abandoned last year. ""Bringing in an amount of fraud can never be the goal,"" the spokesperson said. ""The core must be that people who are entitled to it receive allowances, that unintentional mistakes in applications are prevented, and that fraud is tackled. Without financial objective.""
The spokesperson also said that there are ""no indications"" that fraud teams or employees were evaluated on how much money they recovered. The spokesperson also said that insofar as ""we have been able to verify"" there were no bonuses or special awards for those who achieved most in the hunt for fraud.

"Covid-19 measures, stress may be leading to more domestic violence, experts warn", The sudden change to structure and stress brought on by coronavirus Covid-19 and the measures taken to curb its spread may be leading to more domestic violence in the Netherlands. Both the National Psychotrauma Center at UMC Utrecht and children's hotline Kindertelefoon noticed a sharp increase in calls.  ,https://nltimes.nl/2020/03/27/covid-19-measures-stress-may-leading-domestic-violence-experts-warn,"The sudden change to structure and stress brought on by coronavirus Covid-19 and the measures taken to curb its spread may be leading to more domestic violence in the Netherlands. Both the National Psychotrauma Center at UMC Utrecht and children's hotline Kindertelefoon noticed a sharp increase in calls. 
The Kindertelefoon is receiving around 50 percent more calls than usual since the schools closed nearly two weeks ago. Under normal circumstances, children seek contact around 1 thousand times a day. Now it's around 1,500 ties, director Roline de Wilde said to RTL Nieuws. ""We receive calls from children dealing with sexual abuse, domestic violence and arguments,"" she said. ""That huge increase in telephone calls is worrying us. It is important that we send a signal that this is happening. Especially because this may go on a while.""
De Wilde believes this is connected to families suddenly being forced into constant close contact with each other. All structure changed completely in a matter of days, she said. Tensions are rising in 'problem families', but also in 'ordinary families' who did not have problems before the coronavirus crisis, she said. ""It is a very unreal and troubled time. It all creates tension.""
Iva Bicanic, head of the National Psychotrauma Center, agrees that this crisis situation is causing increased stress and tension in families, she said to RTL Nieuws. ""Parents face stress and are suddenly worried about their job, for example. That's an impulse for child abuse,"" she said. Feeling powerless makes people irritable, she said, stressing the importance of staying alert to this. ""We must actively approach people, reach out.""

"Drunk driver pulled over for ""eating cherry bonbons"""," The driver of a car pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence said he had not been drinking much, but had eaten a large quantity of chocolate-covered cherry bonbons.

He was given a breathalyzer test, which measured a quantity of 275 micrograms of alcohol per liter, about 25 percent over the legal limit.
""The driver indicated that the cherry bonbons had been on sale the previous week, and that these were ‘very tasty!’"" police said. ""He stated that he had had more than one box of the cherry bonbons.”
“Eating chocolates is fine,” the police wrote in a comment on Facebook, “but driving under the influence of alcohol is indeed not acceptable!”
The driver was forbidden from driving for another hour, which police said would allow an adequate amount of time to process the alcohol in his system and reduce it to an allowable level. Punishment will be determined by the prosecutor in the case.
Back eight years ago, a version of the confectionary sold by Hema contained 0.6 milliliters of 192-proof alcohol. A spokesperson at the time told NRC, ""You would have to eat about 42 cherry bonbons to get the same amount as a half-liter of beer (at five percent).""

Vietnamese kids missing from Dutch shelters victims of human trafficking: Rapporteur," A massive 97 percent of Vietnamese children taken in by the protected asylum shelter in the Netherlands have disappeared, according to the National Rapporteur on Human Trafficking and Sexual Violence against Children.

The Netherlands must do something, Rapporteur Herman Bolhaar said, NU.nl reports.
In March last year, Argos and NRC reported that at least 60 Vietnamese children disappeared from the protected shelter between 2013 and 2017. A report recently published by the expertise center on human trafficking and people smuggling EMM and the migration chain analysis center APM concluded that at least 20 Vietnamese children disappeared in the past two year. In total, an estimated 1,750 children have disappeared, the researchers concluded.
Bolhaar calls it beyond time for new measures to protect children coming to seek safety in the Netherlands. ""I find it incomprehensible that this has not happened yet. The Dutch State is also responsible for these children,"" he said, according to the newspaper.
State Secretary Ankie Broekers-Knol of Justice and Security, who is responsible for Asylum, said in a response that this matter is on the national and international agenda.

""It is terrible that this is happening in these times,"" police officer Jan Thijs van Hemmen said. ""To get to the perpetrators, we call on the help of the public. Perhaps someone saw something strange in the night of March 18 to 19 near the health center on Engweg. There may be people who have surveillance cameras in the area.

In a letter to parliament last week, Minister Hugo de Jonge of Public Health also warned of businesses and individuals trying to exploit the coronavirus crisis for financial gain. Stocks were offered at ""extortionate prices"", and in some cases inquiry showed that ""the products were not available at all.""
